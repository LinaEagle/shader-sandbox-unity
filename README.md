# Shader sandbox in Unity

Just a sandbox to explore shaders and collect them.

### Resources and inspirations 
- [material captures](https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps) and [Unity and MatCap](https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/6235ce8fe9c353590fd97c06/unity-i-matcap-627ebde485a5736b501634a2) article


### Dependencies
- Unity version *2021 LTS*. I suppose that the most comfy version to use, because you can use `.shadergraph` both in *built-in* and *URP*, and apparently use `.shader` as usual.
